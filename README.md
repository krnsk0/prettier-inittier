## What is this?

`prettier` doesn't have an `--init` flag to create a default config for you. There are many tools like this, but this one is mine. It installs `prettier`` using the same package manager you use for your project and creates a config file with some sensible defaults.


## Usage
Requires `node` > v18.


```bash
npx prettier-inittier
```

## Configuration
If you don't like the config that is generated by default, you can edit the `.prettier-inittier-default` file that is created in `~` after running the command.
